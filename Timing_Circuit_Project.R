#The goal of this project is to annalyze a timing circuit in order to
#accurately calculate its frequency. This project has two main goals:

#Firstly, to connect a timing circuit to a Rasperry Pi so that it can
#interpret the inputs from the circuit.

#Secondly, to design a software capable of tracking the inputs and
#performing the needed calculations.

#The first goal is being accomplished by Casey Cox. He has acquired the
#Needed circuit, and is working to connect it to the Pi.
